<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![ADD THE SCREENSHOT LINK NEXT TO THIS>>][product-screenshot]](https://piclette.herokuapp.com/#/)

The idea is to build a website that can derive **different** color palettes from photographs. 
My plan is to continue to update this to include accessibility feedback from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>
